# nameless_game_project

Made in Love2D v0.9.1

Just making a game. Well, trying to at least.
Mostly studying game programming.

To build (AKA play what little there is to play), just drag game folder to love.exe.
You can also execute love.exe in terminal and direct it to game folder:
  On linux all you gotta do is have love and type 'love game' on the project folder.
  On windows you have to specify love.exe path AND the game's path.
  On mac I have no fucking idea, but I assume UNIX computers work similarly, so it might work just like linux or not at all.
  
Also, images here are all MINE and done by ME.
Do not post them anywhere, do not claim them as your own.
Do not use them for your own projects, be them with some modifications or none.
If you want to use them for some reason, please contact me at orenjiakira@gmail.com.
I might sound defensive, but if it's for a good reason I will most certainly allow you to use them... So long as you ask first and give proper credit!

As for code, you may copy, use, reuse, abuse, modify and do as you please. Credit would be nice, but not needed.
